## Why the Azure Backlog Matters

The Azure Backlog served as a central pillar for organizing, tracking, and aligning the team's work throughout the project lifecycle. It was more than a task management tool — it was a way to ensure visibility, transparency, and strategic alignment among all team members.

### Key Benefits:
- **Clear Task Ownership:** Every task was assigned, prioritized, and scheduled.
- **Visibility for Stakeholders:** The backlog made it easier to communicate progress and planning with external parties, including our real-world customer.
- **Alignment with Project Goals:** It ensured that every deliverable supported both technical and business objectives.
- **Accountability:** Team members had a clear understanding of what was expected, improving delivery consistency.

## Responding to Personal Feedback from the Professor

The use of the Azure backlog was a direct response to several key points highlighted in the professor’s personal feedback:

### 1. **Professional Project Management Standards**
> *"His approach to documentation and leading the team has been very organized, this is what is expected at real companies."*

The Azure backlog embodies this by simulating a real company environment — using professional tools to manage scope, assign responsibilities, and break down complex work into manageable tasks.

### 2. **Influencing Without Authority**
> *"One of the best ways to influence is by helping with technical work, which is a good way to earn the respect of the team in general."*

The backlog included not only planning and documentation tasks but also technical contributions from the PM (Massimo), helping to create a shared understanding and collaborative environment.

### 3. **Raising the Bar for Team Performance**
> *"PMs should make sure that all team members perform at a high level."*

By clearly documenting expectations, tracking progress, and updating task status, the backlog helped ensure all team members stayed engaged and aligned with project goals.

### 4. **Surpassing Customer Expectations**
> *"It would be good to gather more feedback from the customer and achieve or even surpass expectations."*

The backlog helped prioritize user feedback and translate it into actionable items, allowing us to iterate more effectively and deliver features that truly met the customer's needs.

## Final Thoughts

The Azure backlog is not just a tool — it's part of our mindset. It helped bring structure to our planning, transparency to our communication, and accountability to our execution. This aligns directly with the kind of professionalism, influence, and performance the professor encouraged in his feedback.

By integrating these principles, we aimed not only to meet expectations but to exceed them — both for our customer and as a showcase of our potential in a real-world, professional setting.
