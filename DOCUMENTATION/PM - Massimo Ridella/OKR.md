# Post-V1 Reflection as Product Manager

After completing Version 1 of the FiscoChat project, I noticed that some team members were contributing less than expected.

## Investigation and Insight

Upon further investigation, it became clear that:

- The less active contributors were also the ones who had a weaker understanding of the overall project goals and architecture.
- This lack of clarity led to lower engagement and reduced productivity.

Studies show that team members are more engaged in their work and more productive when they have a clear idea of what the team is trying to achieve and, more importantly, the significance of the task.

## Action Taken

To ensure this does not happen again, I created a shared OKR (Objectives and Key Results) document. This document helps the team by:

- Clarifying goals and expected outcomes
- Assigning ownership and accountability
- Keeping everyone aligned and focused on high-impact tasks

You can view the OKRs [here](https://student-team-wdwtnvyr.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~7120204bba40fc505446678730407c092ddf91/pages/edit-v2/294913).
